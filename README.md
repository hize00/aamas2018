Publication selected for the *2018 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems*, the largest and most influential conference in the area of agents and multiagent systems. The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners in all areas of agent technology.<br>

The publication intends to propose an efficient algorithm for performing joint measurements. Considering an environment represented by a metric graph, the paper proves that the problem of jointly performing measurements from given vertices is NP-hard when either the total traveled distance or the task completion time have to be minimized.<br>
Experiments show that the algorithms perform well in practice, also when compared to an ad hoc method taken from the literature.
